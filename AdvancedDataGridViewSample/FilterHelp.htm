        ADVG.LoadFilter() method allows user to programmatically apply filter to grid (and underlying data source), as if it was selected by end user in filter menus for ADVG columns. LoadFilter() method will first parse filter string, applying each recognized filter part to filter menus in corresponding columns. It will then generate filter event, returning regenerated filter string to hosting form and apply filter to associated BindingSource.
